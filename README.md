# CE/CZ3004 - Multidisciplinary Project

The scope of this multidisciplinary project is to develop a robotic system with diverse functionalities like maze exploration, discovering the shortest path traversal, navigating obstacles and correctly identifying images. The integration of four knowledge spheres (Android, Algorithms, Raspberry Pi and Arduino) is required to implement the Android Remote Controller module, Maze Exploration and Traversal module, and Mobile Remote module of the robotic system.

## Main Tasks
### 1. Fastest Path Task 
Find and navigate the shortest path from the start to the end goal zone. The robot must pass through the Fastest Path Waypoint (FPW) by fully covering the FPW sticker on the maze.
### 2. Image Recognition Task
Identify the images placed on obstacles throughout the maze within 6 minutes. The image id, X and Y coordinates on the obstacles must be determined. The Android should display the id of images on the map and images should be identified accurately with a bounding box.
### 3. Exploration Task
The robot should travel to explore an unknown area from start to goal zone and back to the starting point within 6 minutes.
